# Lists
# they are ordered, changeable, allow duplications and multiple data types

my_list = ["apple", "kiwi", "pear"]
print(my_list)
print()

# Reassigning
my_list = ["apple", "kiwi", "pear", "apple", "apple"]
print(my_list)
print()

# In this case, the old my_list is garbage collected and replaced by the new my_list

# count the list item amount
list_length = len(my_list)
print(list_length)
print()

# Data types in lists
my_list = [100, 15, 77, 99, 300]
print(my_list)

my_list = [True, False, True]
print(my_list)

my_list = ["Apple", 300, True, 400, "Alex", [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]
print(my_list)
print()

# In conclusion, lists can contain many data types but has overhead
